	<p>
		I am currently a Digital Account Manager at Ve Interactive, a tech company located in Boston's South End.  Prior to this, I was a student at The University of New Hampshire studying communication and business.  Spending four years in New Hampshire allowed me to make my best friends of whom I now live with in Southie.

		Before I made the decision to live and work in Boston, I was living in Westchester, New York, where I grew up.  Throughout my childhood I always had a love for technologies and building things out of any objects I could get my hands on.  As I got older, I became enamored by the world of fashion.  A dream of mine would be to merge my love of technology and fashion into a lifelong career.
